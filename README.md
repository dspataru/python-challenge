Module 3 Challenge - pybank and pypoll

## Part 1: PyBank
PyBank is a python script developed to analyze company financial records from a financial dataset called budget_csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". The Python script analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
1. The total number of months included in the dataset.
2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
3. The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes.
4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
5. The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

The PyBank script prints the analysis summary to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.

## Part 2: PyPoll
PyPoll is a python script designed to help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. The script runs on poll data called election_data.csv which is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". PyPoll analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
1. The total number of votes cast.
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won.
4. The total number of votes each candidate won.
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote.

The PyPoll script prints the analysis summary to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.
